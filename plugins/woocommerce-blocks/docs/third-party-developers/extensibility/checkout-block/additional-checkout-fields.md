A common use-case for developers and merchants is to add a new field to the Checkout form to collect additional data about a customer or their order.

This document will outline the steps an extension should take to register some additional checkout fields.

## Available field locations

Additional checkout fields can be registered in three different places:

- Contact information
- Addresses (Shipping **and** Billing)
- Additional information

A field can only be shown in one location, it is not possible to render the same field in multiple locations in the same registration.

### Contact information

The contact information section currently renders at the top of the form. It contains the `email` field and any other additional fields.

<img width="715" alt="image" src="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/assets/5656702/097c2596-c629-4eab-9604-577ee7a14cfe">

Fields rendered here will be saved to the _order_ (i.e. they will not be part of the customer's saved address or account information. New orders will not have any previously used values pre-filled).

### Address

The address section currently contains a form for the shipping address and the billing address. Additional checkout fields can be registered here and they will appear within that form.

<img width="707" alt="image" src="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/assets/5656702/746d280f-3354-4d37-a78a-a2518eb0e5de">

Fields registered here will be saved to both the customer _and_ the order, so returning customers won't need to refill those values again.

If a field is registered in the `address` location it will appear in both the shipping **and** the billing address. It is not possible to have the field in only one of the addresses.

You will also end up collecting two values for this field, one for shipping and one for billing.

### Additional information

As part of the additional checkout fields feature, the checkout block has a new inner block called the "Additional information block".

This block is used to render fields that aren't part of the contact information or address information, for example it may be a "How did you hear about us" field or a "Gift message" field.

Fields rendered here will be saved to the order. They will not be part of the customer's saved address or account information. New orders will not have any previously used values pre-filled.

<img width="724" alt="image" src="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/assets/5656702/295b3048-a22a-4225-96b0-6b0371a7cd5f">

By default, this block will render as the last step in the Checkout form, however it can be moved using the Gutenberg block controls in the editor.

## Supported field types

The following field types are supported:

- `select`
- `text`
- `checkbox`

There are plans to expand this list, but for now these are the types available.

## Using the API

To register additional checkout fields you must use the `woocommerce_blocks_register_checkout_field` function.

It is recommended to run this function after the `woocommerce_loaded` action.

The registration function takes an array of options describing your field. Some field types take additional options.

### Options

#### General options

These options apply to all field types (except in a few circumstances which are noted inline).

| Option name     | Description                                                                                                                            | Required? | Example                                      | Default value                                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | The field's ID. This should be a unique identifier for your field. It is composed of a namespace and field name separated by a `/`.    | Yes       | `plugin-namespace/how-did-you-hear`          | No default - this must be provided.                                        |
| `label`         | The label shown on your field. This will be the placeholder too.                                                                       | Yes       | `How did you hear about us?`                 | No default - this must be provided.                                        |
| `optionalLabel` | The label shown on your field if it is optional. This will be the placeholder too.                                                     | No        | `How did you hear about us? (Optional)`      | The default value will be the value of `label` with `(optional)` appended. |
| `location`      | The location to render your field.                                                                                                     | Yes       | `contact`, `address`, or `additional`        | No default - this must be provided.                                        |
| `type`          | The type of field you're rendering. It defaults to `text` and must match one of the supported field types.                             | No        | `text`, `select`, or `checkbox`              | `text`                                                                     |
| `attributes`    | An array of additional attributes to render on the field's input element. This is _not_ supported for `select` fields.                 | No        | `[	'data-custom-data' => 'my-custom-data' ]` | `[]`                                                                       |

#### Options for `text` fields

As well as the options above, text fields also support a `required` option. If this is `true` then the shopper _must_ provide a value for this field during the checkout process.

| Option name     | Description                                                                                                                         | Required? | Example                                      | Default value |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|---|
| `required` | If this is `true` then the shopper _must_ provide a value for this field during the checkout process. | No | `true` | `false` |

#### Options for `select` fields

As well as the options above, select fields must also be registered with an  `options` option. This is used to specify what options the shopper can select.

Select fields are always required.

The `optionalLabel` option will never be shown as select fields are _always_ required.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Option name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
		<th>Required?</th>
		<th>Example</th>
		<th>Default value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>

`options`

</td>
		<td>

An array of options to show in the select input. Each options must be an array containing a `label` and `value` property. Each entry must have a unique `value`. Any duplicate options will be removed. The `value` is what gets submitted to the server during checkout and the `label` is simply a user-friendly representation of this value. It is not transmitted to the server in any way.</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>

	[
		[
			'value' => 'store_1',
			'label' => 'Our London Store'
		],
		[
			'value' => 'store_2',
			'label' => 'Our Paris Store'
		],
		[
			'value' => 'store_3',
			'label' => 'Our New York Store'
		]
	]

</td>
		<td>
			No default - this must be provided.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Options for `checkbox` fields

The checkbox field type does not have any specific options, however `required` will always be `false` for a checkbox field. Making a checkbox field required is not supported.

### Attributes

Adding additional attributes to checkbox and text fields is supported. Adding them to select fields is **not possible for now**.

These attributes have a 1:1 mapping to the HTML attributes on `input` elements (except `pattern` on checkbox).

The supported attributes are:

- `data-*` attributes
- `aria-*` attributes
- `autocomplete`
- `autocapitalize`
- `pattern` (not supported on checkbox fields)
- `title`
- `maxLength` (equivalent to `maxlength` HTML attribute)
- `readOnly` (equivalent to `readonly` HTML attribute)

`maxLength` and `readOnly` are in camelCase because the attributes are rendered on a React element which must receive them in this format.

## Usage examples

### Rendering a text field

This example demonstrates rendering a text field in the address section:

```php
add_action(
	'woocommerce_loaded',
	function() {
		woocommerce_blocks_register_checkout_field(
			array(
				'id'            => 'namespace/gov-id',
				'label'         => 'Government ID',
				'optionalLabel' => 'Government ID (optional)',
				'location'      => 'address',
				'required'      => true,
				'attributes'    => array(
					'autocomplete'     => 'government-id',
					'aria-describedby' => 'some-element',
					'aria-label'       => 'custom aria label',
					'pattern'          => '[A-Z0-9]{5}', // A 5-character string of capital letters and numbers.
					'title'            => 'Title to show on hover',
					'data-custom'      => 'custom data',
				),
			),
		);
	}
);
```

This results in the following address form (the billing form will be the same):

<img width="696" alt="image" src="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/assets/5656702/f6eb3c6f-9178-4978-8e74-e6b2ea353192">

The rendered markup looks like this:

```html
<input type="text" id="shipping-namespace/gov-id" autocapitalize="off"
       autocomplete="government-id" aria-label="custom aria label"
       aria-describedby="some-element" required="" aria-invalid="true"
       title="Title to show on hover" pattern="[A-Z0-9]{5}"
       data-custom="custom data" value="" >
```

### Rendering a checkbox field

This example demonstrates rendering a checkbox field in the contact information section:

```php
add_action(
	'woocommerce_loaded',
	function() {
		woocommerce_blocks_register_checkout_field(
			array(
				'id'       => 'namespace/marketing-opt-in',
				'label'    => 'Do you want to subscribe to our newsletter?',
				'location' => 'contact',
				'type'     => 'checkbox',
			)
		);
	}
);
```

This results in the following contact information section:

<img width="721" alt="image" src="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/assets/5656702/7444e41a-97cc-451d-b2c9-4eedfbe05724">

Note that because an `optionalLabel` was not supplied, the string `(optional)` is appended to the label. To remove that an `optionalLabel` property should be supplied to override this.

### Rendering a select field

This example demonstrates rendering a select field in the additional information section:

```php
add_action(
	'woocommerce_loaded',
	function() {
		woocommerce_blocks_register_checkout_field(
			array(
				'id'       => 'namespace/how-did-you-hear-about-us',
				'label'    => 'How did you hear about us?',
				'location' => 'additional',
				'type'     => 'select',
				'options'  => [
					[
						'value' => 'google',
						'label' => 'Google'
					],
					[
						'value' => 'facebook',
						'label' => 'Facebook'
					],
					[
						'value' => 'friend',
						'label' => 'From a friend'
					],
					[
						'value' => 'other',
						'label' => 'Other'
					],
				]
			)
		);
	}
);
```

This results in the additional information section being rendered like so:

<p>
	<img width="701" alt="image" src="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/assets/5656702/bbe17ad0-7c7d-419a-951d-315f56f8898a"><br />
	<em>The select input before being focused</em>
</p>

<p>
	<img width="724" alt="image" src="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/assets/5656702/bd943906-621b-404f-aa84-b951323e25d3"><br />
	<em>The select input when focused</em>
</p>

If it is undesirable to force the shopper to select a value, providing a value such as "None of the above" may help.

## Validation

It is possible to add custom validation to any registered additional checkout field as long as you know its namespace and ID.

To do so, use the `woocommerce_blocks_validate_additional_field_{id}` filter.

For example to apply validation to the example text field above use the `woocommerce_blocks_validate_additional_field_namespace/gov-id` filter.

This filter receives the following arguments, in order.


| Argument        | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$error`        | `WP_Error`        | A `WP_Error` object. Initially it is empty. This filter should add errors to it using the [`add`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_error/add/) method. The returned value of this filter must be the _same_ WP_Error that was passed to it. |
| `$field_value`  | `mixed`           | The current value of the field, i.e. what the user entered in the checkout form.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `$field_schema` | `array`           | The schema of the field. This is what is registered with Store API. This is useful to know what values are valid for select fields.                                                                                                                             |
| `$request`      | `WP_Rest_Request` | The current request made to the checkout endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Example

The below example will show how it is possible to apply custom validation to the `namespace/gov-id` text field from above.

The custom validation rules in this example could be done with a pattern but it might also be a good idea to check this again during submission since front-end validation can be bypassed.

As a reminder, the `pattern` used above is `[A-Z0-9]{5}` (any 5-character string containing capital letters and numbers).

```php
add_filter('woocommerce_blocks_validate_additional_field_namespace/gov-id', function ( \WP_Error $error, $value, $schema, $key ) {
	$match = preg_match( '/[A-Z0-9]{5}/', $value );
	if ( 0 === $match || false === $match ) {
		$error->add( 'invalid_gov_id', 'Please ensure your government ID matches the correct format.' );
	}
	return $error;
}, 10, 4);
```

It is important to note that the filter must always return the _same_ `WP_Error` object it receives. Returning a different `WP_Error` or any other type will cause validation for this field to be skipped _completely_, even skipping other filters for this field.

If no validation errors are encountered, the original `WP_Error` (which starts off with no errors inside it) should be returned.

## A full example

In this full example we will register the Government ID text field and verify that it conforms to a single pattern.

This example is just a full version of the examples shared above.

	add_action(
		'woocommerce_loaded',
		function() {
			woocommerce_blocks_register_checkout_field(
				array(
					'id'            => 'namespace/gov-id',
					'label'         => 'Government ID',
					'optionalLabel' => 'Government ID (optional)',
					'location'      => 'address',
					'required'      => true,
					'attributes'    => array(
						'autocomplete' => 'government-id',
						'pattern'      => '[A-Z0-9]{5}', // A 5-character string of capital letters and numbers.
						'title'        => 'Your 5-digit Government ID',
					),
				),
			);

			add_filter(
				'woocommerce_blocks_validate_additional_field_namespace/gov-id',
				function ( \WP_Error $error, $value, $schema, $key ) {
					$match = preg_match( '/[A-Z0-9]{5}/', $value );
					if ( 0 === $match || false === $match ) {
						$error->add( 'invalid_gov_id', 'Please ensure your government ID matches the correct format.' );
					}
					return $error;
				}
			);
		},
		10,
		4
	);
